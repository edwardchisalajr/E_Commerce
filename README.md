# E_Tutoring Management System
The system acts as an online platform in which students registered at a university
can be taught various courses online offered.
The system comprises of four users, that is the Student, Tutor, Administrator and Staff
Member. Each one of these users have access to different sections of the system
depending on their user type in the system. Students for example, can interact with
their own tutors through instant messaging, view and register courses as well as
record meetings between them and their tutor. Tutors can access their own private
dashboard that lists their tutees, upload documents for students to see and have
access to a forum where a tutor can interact and share ideas amongst his/her students.
The administrator acts as a super user that monitors and manages all transactions
and actions within the system. Staff Members have access of the individual student
dashboards and other staff members that is to say they act as second in command to
the administrator
